<!--Text about why I chose to make this website-->
   <p id="info"> 
    My name is Chanell and ever since I was very small, I've been passionate about nature and wildlife, 
    how each plant and animal lives differently fascinates me.
    <br><br>
    I made this website as part of a project, and frequently being around nature and sea inspired me to do it on the Wildlife
    of Ireland.
    <br><br>
    My goal is to provide information to those who love nature, or those who are just curious and love to learn new things.
    My website offers educational inoformation that cover a variety of topics such as the different land  and sea animals, 
    wildflowers, herbs etc...
    <br><br>
    If you would like to contact me directly about any questions you may have,  my details are provided in the 'Contact' page.
