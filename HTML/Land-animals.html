    and their big antlers.

    Deer inhabit the forests, grasslands and some parks around Ireland. As mentioned above, they are a common sight
    in Phoenix Park. They are more trusting towards people than wild deer found in other parts of Ireland, if you are lucky,
    you might even be able to feed them! Although it is not recommended as they are still wild and have natural instincts.
