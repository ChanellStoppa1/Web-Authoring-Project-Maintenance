    <!--Information about animal-->
    <p class="wildlife">
        In Ireland, red squirrels finish hibernating in late winter or early spring, typically around February or March.
        <br><br> 
        Red squirrels are distinguished by their rusty red fur, they become productive again, they search for nuts, seeds, 
        and fruits in woodland areas.
        <br><br> 
        During this time, they also spend time making baby squirrels, which are born in late spring/ early summer. 
        Their return in spring means new life in the Irish countryside.
    </p>

     <h3>Frog</h3>

    </p>

    <p class="wildlife">
        During the winter months, frogs in Ireland enter a dormant state, also known as brumation, to survive the cold conditions.
        <br><br>  
        They hide in sheltered areas, under logs, rocks, or in muddy ponds, where they are protected until spring. When spring comes, 
        the frogs come out and look for a partner. 
        <br><br><br><br> 
        Once a partner is found, the female brings him back to the pond with eggs. In a week or so, these eggs become tadpoles, and then frogs.
    </p>

     <h3>Hedgehog</h3>

    </p>

    <p class="wildlife">
        In spring, hedgehogs in Ireland come out from their winter hibernation, during the night, they search of food and mating partners.
        <br><br> 
        They eat various insects and worms. Mother hedgehogs build nests for their babies, called hoglets, 
        hoglets rely on their parents for care and protection. 
        <br><br> 
        Hedgehogs play a vital role in the ecosystem, providing natural pest control and adding beauty to the Irish countryside in springtime.
